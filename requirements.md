Only hosts can manage their own listings.

Properties must include availability and pricing details.

API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/v1/properties	Create a new property
GET	/api/v1/properties	Retrieve all available properties
GET	/api/v1/properties/:id	Retrieve details of a specific property
PATCH	/api/v1/properties/:id	Update property details
DELETE	/api/v1/properties/:id	Remove a property listing
Input / Output
Create Property (POST /api/v1/properties)

Input:

{
  "name": "Cozy Apartment",
  "description": "2-bedroom apartment in downtown",
  "location": "Cairo, Egypt",
  "price_per_night": 85.00,
  "amenities": ["Wi-Fi", "AC", "Kitchen"]
}


Output:

{
  "message": "Property created successfully",
  "property_id": "uuid"
}

Validation Rules

price_per_night must be numeric and positive.

name, description, and location are required.

Only users with role = host can create or edit properties.

Performance Criteria

Retrieve all properties in < 500ms for 1000+ listings using pagination and indexing.

üè° 3. Booking System
Description

Allows guests to book properties and view booking status.

Functional Requirements

Guests can create bookings for available dates.

Prevent overlapping (double) bookings.

Hosts can confirm or cancel bookings.

Automatically calculate total price based on date range.

API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/v1/bookings	Create a new booking
GET	/api/v1/bookings	Retrieve all bookings (guest or host view)
PATCH	/api/v1/bookings/:id/status	Update booking status
DELETE	/api/v1/bookings/:id	Cancel a booking
Input / Output
Create Booking (POST /api/v1/bookings)

Input:

{
  "property_id": "uuid",
  "start_date": "2025-11-10",
  "end_date": "2025-11-15"
}


Output:

{
  "message": "Booking created successfully",
  "booking_id": "uuid",
  "total_price": 425.00,

üîí Security & Error Handling (Applies to All)

Passwords stored with strong hashing (e.g., bcrypt).

All endpoints require authentication except register/login.

Consistent error response format:

{
  "error": "Invalid input",
  "details": "Email already exists"
}
