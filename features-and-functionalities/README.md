# Features & Functionalities ‚Äî Airbnb Clone (Backend)

## üìå Overview

This document lists the key features and backend functionalities required for the Airbnb Clone project. Use it as the single source of truth when designing APIs, database models, and system architecture. A visual design (Draw.io) should be created to represent these features and their relationships, then exported as a `PNG` and placed in this folder.

## üîë Core Functionalities

### 1. User Management

* **User Registration**: Sign up as `guest` or `host`.

  * Input validation, email uniqueness check.
  * Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2).
* **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication (access + refresh tokens).

  * Login (email + password).
  * OAuth (Google, Facebook) ‚Äî optional.
* **Authorization / RBAC**:

  * Roles: `guest`, `host`, `admin`.
  * Role-restricted endpoints (e.g., host-only property creation).
* **Profile Management**:

  * Update profile (name, bio, contact, profile photo).
  * Verification flags (email_verified, phone_verified).

### 2. Property Listings Management

* **Create Listing** (host only): title, description, location, price_per_night, amenities, images, availability rules.
* **Edit / Delete Listing**: host can modify or remove listings.
* **Gallery / Media**: upload multiple images (S3 / Cloudinary) with metadata (caption, order).
* **Availability Calendar**: store blocked dates and booked ranges.

### 3. Search & Filtering

* **Search by**: location, date range, price range, guest count, amenities.
* **Sorting & Pagination**: sort by price, rating, distance; paginate results.
* **Advanced Filters**: host rating, property type, cancellation policy.
* **Geo queries**: approximate by city or radius (if geo coordinates available).

### 4. Booking Management

* **Create Booking**: guest selects dates, system validates availability & prevents double-booking.
* **Booking Lifecycle**: statuses ‚Üí `pending`, `confirmed`, `canceled`, `completed`.
* **Cancellation Policies**: implement refund rules and timelines.
* **Booking History**: guests & hosts can view past and future bookings.

### 5. Payment Integration

* **Payment Gateways**: Stripe/PayPal (tokenized payments).
* **Payment Flows**: authorize & capture, refunds, payout schedules to hosts.
* **Multi-currency Support**: store currency code and converted amounts.
* **Receipts & Invoices**: generate payment records and receipts.

### 6. Reviews & Ratings

* **Write Review**: guest can leave rating (1‚Äì5) and comment linked to a completed booking.
* **Host Responses**: hosts can reply to reviews.
* **Abuse Prevention**: reviews tied to booking IDs to prevent fake reviews.
* **Aggregate Ratings**: compute property/host ratings for display.

### 7. Messaging & Notifications

* **Messaging**: in-app messages between guest and host (threaded or single channel).
* **Notifications**:

  * Email (SendGrid/Mailgun) for confirmations, cancellations, payout notices.
  * In-app / push notifications for real-time updates.
* **Webhooks**: handle payment / third-party events.

### 8. Admin Dashboard

* **User Management**: suspend/ban users, view user activity.
* **Listings Moderation**: approve/remove listings, flag content.
* **Booking & Payment Oversight**: refunds, disputes, transaction logs.
* **Analytics & Reports**: basic metrics (revenue, bookings, active listings).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

* **Database**: Relational DB (Postgres or MySQL). Tables: users, properties, bookings, payments, reviews, messages, media, availability.
* **API**: RESTful endpoints (recommended). Use proper HTTP verbs & status codes.
* **Auth**: JWT (access + refresh), RBAC.
* **File Storage**: Cloud storage for media (S3 / Cloudinary). Store URLs in DB.
* **Third-Party Services**: Stripe/PayPal, SendGrid/Mailgun.
* **Caching**: Redis for sessions, rate limiting, and caching expensive queries (search results).
* **Background Jobs**: Celery / RQ for emails, payouts, nightly tasks.
* **Logging & Monitoring**: centralized logging (ELK/CloudWatch) and health checks.

---

## üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements

* **Scalability**: modular services, horizontallly scalable API servers behind load balancers.
* **Security**: encrypt sensitive data, use HTTPS, secure cookies for refresh tokens, rate limit APIs.
* **Performance**: index foreign keys & search columns, optimize joins, paginate heavy endpoints.
* **Testing**: unit tests, integration tests, automated API tests. Use CI pipeline.

## üìê Draw.io Diagram ‚Äî Instructions

1. Open [https://app.diagrams.net/](https://app.diagrams.net/).
2. Create a diagram that includes:

   * Main entities: Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, Reviews, Messages, Media, Availability.
   * Arrows showing relationships (1‚ÄîM, M‚ÄîM where relevant).
   * Notes on key constraints (unique email, FK relations, enum statuses).
   * Optional: a small flow for "booking lifecycle" and "payment flow".
3. Export the diagram as a **PNG** (File ‚Üí Export ‚Üí PNG).
4. Save the PNG to this folder: `features-and-functionalities/airbnb-backend-features.png`.

---

## ‚úÖ Deliverables (what to commit)

* `README.md` (this file).
* `airbnb-backend-features.png` (Draw.io export) inside `features-and-functionalities/`.
* Optional: a `.drawio` file for future edits.

## üßæ Git commands (example)

```bash
# from repo root
git checkout -b docs/features-and-functionalities
mkdir -p features-and-functionalities
# place README.md and PNG inside folder
git add features-and-functionalities/README.md features-and-functionalities/airbnb-backend-features.png
git commit -m "docs: add features & functionalities doc + diagram"
git push origin HEAD
```

## üìé Notes

* Keep this document updated as features evolve. Treat it as living documentation used by backend and full-stack engineers.
* If you want, I can also draft the Draw.io diagram for you and provide the PNG file ready to commit.
